<h1>Basic Text Editor </h1>
<h3>What is Text Editor</h3>
<h4>A text editor is a software tool that allows you to write and edit plain text. It's different from word processors like Microsoft Word because it doesn't add formatting like bold or italic, it just focuses on the text itself.  </h4>
<h2>BUT</h2>
<H4>This text editor not only supports formatting features like bold, italic, and headings but also allows you to export your content in various formats, including text and PDF files. You can seamlessly apply formatting using Markdown syntax and then download your data in the format of your choice, making it convenient for sharing or archiving your documents.
